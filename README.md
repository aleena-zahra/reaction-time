# Reaction Time Game with Pygame

My first-ever game using Pygame! This is a super simple game designed to test your reaction time. Follow the instructions and see how fast you can react to the prompts. 

## Instructions:

1. **Start:** Click the "START" button to begin the game.
2. **Wait:** After starting, a message will appear, "GET READY...". Wait for the screen to change.
3. **Click:** When the screen changes to red and displays "CLICK!", click as quickly as possible.
4. **Result:** Your reaction time will be displayed in milliseconds. The faster, the better!

## Dependencies:

Make sure you have Pygame installed. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Controls:

- Mouse Click: Start the game, react to prompts.

## Game Logic:

- The game progresses through different states: Start, Wait, Click, Result.
- Pay attention to the instructions and react accordingly.
- The reaction time is calculated and displayed at the end of each round.

## Notes:

- This is a simple project for learning purposes.
- Feel free to modify and enhance the code to add more features or improve the game mechanics.

Have fun testing your reaction time! If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to let me know.
